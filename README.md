Main move moves all the joints
Itâ€™s basically a sequence for move, but it is very easy to change direction and move backwards, moving to the left and right required a bit more work but when accomplished then with a little more work (just rewriting my old code from python) be possible for the robot to go in literally any direction, the hard part is making it hold balance by itself
